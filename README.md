# Resolution_analysis
This is a python jupyter notebook that go step by step to analyze edge spread function (ESF) from a half black half white noisy image.
In the images examples the images that here are taken where the sample is tilted so that the top is above the focal plane and the bottom of the image is below the focus plane. This assure us that there is a part of the image is in the focus plane. To increase the SNR I first make sure that the border between the black and white is vertically aligned then I sum over several horizontal lines around the focal plan.
